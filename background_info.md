### Differences Between Pediatric and Adult Brain Tumors

- **Tumor Location**[1]: In children, tumors often occur in the cerebellum and brainstem, affecting motor control and balance. In adults, they typically arise in the cerebral hemispheres, such as the frontal or temporal lobes, impacting language, memory, and cognition.

- **Brain Morphology**: Children's brains are rounder and have different gray/white matter ratios compared to adults.

- **Developmental Differences**: The development of gray and white matter differs between the two groups.

- **MRI Differences**[2]: Due to less myelination in childrenâ€™s brains, T1-weighted MRIs show less contrast between gray and white matter, making structural boundaries harder to distinguish. Therefore using adult templates for pediatric analysis may cause misinterpretations.

### About T1-weighted MRI[3]

T1, T2 weighted MRIs are differentiated by relaxation time. T1-weighted MRIs have longitudinal relaxation time while T2-weighted MRIs have transverse relaxation time. T1-weighted MRIs have short TR(repetitition time) and TE(time to echo), while T2-weighted MRIs have long TR and TE. T1-weighted MRIs show fats brightly, and CSF darkly, while T2-weighted MRIs show fats relatively darkly, and CSF brightly.
